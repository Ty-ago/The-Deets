👋 Hi, I’m @Ty-ago but my human name is Tyisiah (Ty for short because I know that's a tough one to pronounce and type out)

👀 I’m interested in building a better internet and creating software for projects that help people of all walks of life.

🌱 I’m currently learning to use Git, the CSS grid and flexbox, as well as JQuery and the concepts around working with the DOM in OOP.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that change the way we do things, make us rethink what we know, or anything that helps people.
