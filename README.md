👋  Hi, I’m @Ty-ago but my human name is Tyisiah (Ty for short because I know that can be a tough one to pronounce and type out)

👀  I’m interested in building a better internet and creating software for projects that help people of all walks of life.

🌱  I’m currently learning to use Git, UI/UX Design, the world of CSS3 and Responsive design using the CSS grid and flexbox, JQuery and the concepts around working with the DOM in OOP, and creating Web and Mobile applications using Vanilla JS.

💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that change the way we do things, make us rethink what we know, or anything that helps people use the net.
